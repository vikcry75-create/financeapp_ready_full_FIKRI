FinanceApp - Merah Putih (Ready-to-run helper)
=============================================

This package contains Dart source and assets for a red-white themed Finance App with local persistence (sqflite).
Because native android/ios folders should be generated by your installed Flutter tool for best compatibility,
this archive includes setup scripts that will run `flutter create --org ac.id financeapp` on your machine and copy the contents.

Files included:
- lib/ (full Flutter source)
- assets/images/utb_logo.png
- pubspec.yaml
- setup.sh (Unix/macOS/Linux)
- setup.bat (Windows)

How to install (macOS / Linux):
1. Ensure `flutter` is installed and on PATH.
2. Extract this zip.
3. In terminal: chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
4. cd financeapp
5. flutter pub get
6. flutter run

How to install (Windows):
